* First
  * In the first form the user will have to enter the text for which they have to auto generate!
  * Next they will add all the placeholders for the text which will be changed
  * On generate the second form will be displayed
  
* Second
  * In this a table control will be there where columns are mapped to the placeholders they added in the previous form
  * The user will have to add number of rows which they want (all these adding controls will be in the menubar) 
  * And from this form they can generate the automated text

# List of features

* Generate numbers ( n1 to n2) 
* Generate alphabets (a-z or A-Z or a-Z or c1 to c2 to generalize)  
* Generate from list of files
* Generate from a text file (each line mapping to a row) 
* Insert from a dialog (, or any other delimeter seperated text)


# Where this can be used

* Making some automated text in generic code (like a keyboard or some big if condition ladder)
* Generating image gallery in HTML
* To generate some python scripts (like mass email sending) [Not inefficient python prog this would be, but can be an application]

# Plan 

* V1 to include this standalone program 
* V2 to include plugin for IntelliJ
* V3 to include plugin for atom text editor
